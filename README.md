Devtool: Unserialize object and  reverse engineer to PHP code

Sometimes, one tap into an exisitng structure, to example in a wordpress database. One need to create a serialized object of the same kind in a plugin or other code to manipulate this object. 

This tool lets you create a PHP sample for this object that can be altered to produce that kind of serialized structure.
